My Github page

This was my first portfolio site while I was a student at Wyncode.  Eventually it will redirect to my new portfolio.

To see how looks, you can open the HTML file in your browser or you can type `rails s` in terminal to run it locally.

To see it live, [nbdewaele.github.io](https://nbdewaele.github.io)
